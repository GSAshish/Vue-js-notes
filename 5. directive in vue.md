`v-on` can be written as `@` coz we use them very frequently

Directives are special attributes in Vue.js that allow you to apply reactive behavior to elements in the DOM (Document Object Model) when rendering a Vue component. They are prefixed with the `v-` notation in the HTML template.

Vue.js provides several built-in directives that enable you to manipulate the DOM, control rendering, bind data, and handle events. Here are some commonly used directives:

1. `v-if` and `v-else`: These directives conditionally render or remove elements based on a condition.

```html
<div v-if="isShown">This element is shown.</div>
<div v-else>This element is hidden.</div>
```

2. `v-for`: This directive renders a block or element multiple times based on an array or object.

```html
<ul>
  <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">{{ item.name }}</li>
</ul>
```

3. `v-bind` or `:`: This directive is used to bind values dynamically to an element's attributes.

```html
<img :src="imageUrl" alt="Product Image">
<a :href="linkUrl">Click here</a>
```

4. `v-on` or `@`: This directive is used to attach event listeners to elements.

```html
<button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>
<input @input="handleInput">
```

5. `v-model`: This directive creates a two-way data binding between a form input element and a data property.

```html
<input v-model="message" type="text">
<p>You entered: {{ message }}</p>
```

6. `v-show`: This directive toggles the visibility of an element based on a condition, using CSS display property.

```html
<p v-show="isVisible">This element is shown/hidden.</p>
```

These are just a few examples of the directives provided by Vue.js. You can also create custom directives to add your own behavior to elements. Directives are powerful tools that enhance the flexibility and interactivity of Vue.js components.
