I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was an error in my previous response. With Vite, you don't need to manually install Vue.js. The Vite project template already includes Vue.js as a dependency. Please follow the corrected steps below:

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

Step 2: Install Vite
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Vite globally:

```
npm install -g create-vite
```

Step 3: Create a new Vue project
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Vue project, then run the following command:

```
create-vite my-app --template vue
```

Replace `my-app` with the desired name for your application. This command will create a new directory with the project files and install the necessary dependencies, including Vue.js.

Step 4: Navigate to the project directory
After the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

```
cd my-app
```

Step 5: Run the development server
To start the development server and see your Vue application in action, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command compiles and hot-reloads the project, allowing you to view your Vue application in the browser. It also provides you with a development URL where you can access your application.

I apologize for the confusion caused by the previous response, and I appreciate your understanding.
