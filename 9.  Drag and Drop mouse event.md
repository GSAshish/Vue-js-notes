Drag and drop functionality involves a combination of mouse events to handle the dragging and dropping of elements. In Vue.js, you can use the following mouse events to implement drag and drop interactions:

1. `@mousedown`: This event is triggered when the mouse button is pressed down on the draggable element. It marks the start of the drag operation.

```html
<div @mousedown="handleDragStart">Draggable Element</div>
```

2. `@mousemove`: This event is triggered when the mouse pointer moves while the mouse button is pressed down. It provides the dragging effect by updating the position of the dragged element.

```html
<div @mousemove="handleDrag">Draggable Element</div>
```

3. `@mouseup`: This event is triggered when the mouse button is released after dragging the element. It marks the end of the drag operation.

```html
<div @mouseup="handleDragEnd">Draggable Element</div>
```

4. `@dragstart`: This event is triggered when the drag operation starts on an element. It is often used in conjunction with `@mousedown` to customize the drag behavior.

```html
<div draggable="true" @dragstart="handleDragStart">Draggable Element</div>
```

5. `@dragenter` and `@dragleave`: These events are triggered when a draggable element enters or leaves a drop zone element.

```html
<div @dragenter="handleDragEnter" @dragleave="handleDragLeave">Drop Zone</div>
```

6. `@dragover`: This event is triggered when a draggable element is being dragged over a drop zone element. It is necessary to prevent the default behavior to allow dropping.

```html
<div @dragover.prevent="handleDragOver">Drop Zone</div>
```

7. `@drop`: This event is triggered when a draggable element is dropped onto a drop zone element.

```html
<div @drop="handleDrop">Drop Zone</div>
```

By combining these mouse events, you can implement drag and drop functionality in Vue.js. You would typically define methods in your Vue component to handle these events and update the state or perform necessary actions based on the drag and drop interactions.
