Mouse events are commonly used in web development to respond to user interactions with the mouse. Vue.js provides convenient directives to handle mouse events within its components. Here are some frequently used mouse events in Vue.js:

1. `@click`: This event is triggered when the element is clicked.

```html
<button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>
```

2. `@mouseover` and `@mouseout`: These events are triggered when the mouse pointer enters or leaves the element.

```html
<div @mouseover="handleMouseOver" @mouseout="handleMouseOut">Hover over me</div>
```

3. `@mousedown`, `@mouseup`, and `@mousemove`: These events are triggered when the mouse button is pressed down, released, or moved over the element, respectively.

```html
<div @mousedown="handleMouseDown" @mouseup="handleMouseUp" @mousemove="handleMouseMove">Drag me</div>
```

4. `@contextmenu`: This event is triggered when the element's context menu (usually right-click menu) is requested.

```html
<div @contextmenu="handleContextMenu">Right-click me</div>
```

5. `@dblclick`: This event is triggered when the element is double-clicked.

```html
<div @dblclick="handleDoubleClick">Double-click me</div>
```

These are just a few examples of mouse events in Vue.js. You can attach these events to any element in your Vue components and define corresponding methods to handle the event and perform desired actions. Additionally, you can access event-related data, such as event properties or the target element, within the event handler methods.
