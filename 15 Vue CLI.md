To create a new Vue.js application using the Vue CLI (Command Line Interface), you'll need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Vue CLI
If you haven't installed the Vue CLI globally on your machine, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Step 2: Create a new Vue project
Once Vue CLI is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Vue project. Then run the following command:

```
vue create my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with the desired name for your application. Vue CLI will set up the project and ask you to choose a preset. You can either select the default preset or manually select features based on your project's requirements.

Step 3: Navigate to the project directory
After the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

```
cd my-app
```

Step 4: Run the development server
To start the development server and see your Vue application in action, run the following command:

```
npm run serve
```

This command compiles and hot-reloads the project, allowing you to view your Vue application in the browser. It also provides you with a development URL where you can access your application.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new Vue.js application using the Vue CLI. Now you can start building your application by modifying the generated project files and creating your Vue components.
