Teleport is a feature introduced in Vue 3 that allows you to render content at a different place in the DOM hierarchy. It is useful for creating components that need to be rendered outside their parent components or in a specific container. Here are the different ways to use teleport in Vue:

1. Using `teleport` component:
The most common way to use teleport is by using the `teleport` component. You can wrap the content you want to teleport in a `teleport` component and specify the target container using the `to` attribute.

```html
<teleport to="target-container">
  <!-- Content to be teleported -->
</teleport>
```

Here, `target-container` is the CSS selector for the target container where the content will be rendered. It can be an ID, class, or any valid CSS selector.

2. Using `v-teleport` directive:
Alternatively, you can use the `v-teleport` directive to teleport content without using the `teleport` component. You can apply the `v-teleport` directive directly to an element and specify the target container using a string or an element reference.

```html
<div v-teleport:target-container>
  <!-- Content to be teleported -->
</div>
```

In this case, `target-container` can be either a string representing a CSS selector or a direct reference to the target container element.

3. Using dynamic teleport targets:
You can also use dynamic values to determine the teleport target at runtime. This can be useful when you want to dynamically choose different containers based on certain conditions.

```html
<teleport :to="teleportTarget">
  <!-- Content to be teleported -->
</teleport>
```

In this example, `teleportTarget` is a computed property or a data property that holds the CSS selector or element reference of the target container.

These are the different ways to use teleport in Vue.js. Whether you use the `teleport` component or the `v-teleport` directive, it provides a powerful way to render content at different places in the DOM hierarchy, enabling more flexible and dynamic component rendering.
