In Vue.js, event modifiers allow you to modify the behavior of event handlers in templates. They provide a way to handle events with additional functionality or to override default behavior. Here are some examples of event modifiers in Vue:

1. `@click.prevent`: The `.prevent` modifier prevents the default behavior of an event. For example, you can use it to prevent the default form submission behavior of a button.

```html
<button @click.prevent="submitForm">Submit</button>
```

2. `@click.stop`: The `.stop` modifier stops the event propagation, preventing it from bubbling up to parent elements. It's useful when you want to prevent parent elements from triggering their own click handlers.

```html
<div @click.stop="doSomething">
  <button @click="doSomethingElse">Button</button>
</div>
```

3. `@click.self`: The `.self` modifier only triggers the event handler if the event originated from the element itself. It ignores clicks that occur on child elements.

```html
<div @click.self="doSomething">
  <button @click="doSomethingElse">Button</button>
</div>
```

4. `@keyup.enter`: The `.enter` modifier triggers the event handler only when the Enter key is pressed. It's commonly used in form inputs to submit the form when the user presses Enter.

```html
<input type="text" @keyup.enter="submitForm">
```

5. `@keydown.esc`: The `.esc` modifier triggers the event handler when the Escape key is pressed. It's useful for implementing cancel or close functionality.

```html
<button @keydown.esc="cancel">Cancel</button>
```

These are just a few examples of event modifiers available in Vue.js. Event modifiers provide a convenient way to handle events with added functionality or customization without the need for additional JavaScript code.
