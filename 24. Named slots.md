Certainly! Named slots in Vue.js allow you to define multiple slots in a child component and give them specific names. This gives you more control over where the content from the parent component is rendered within the child component. Here's an example:

ParentComponent.vue:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Parent Component</h2>
    <ChildComponent>
      <template v-slot:header>
        <h3>Header Slot Content</h3>
      </template>
      <template v-slot:footer>
        <p>Footer Slot Content</p>
      </template>
    </ChildComponent>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    ChildComponent
  }
};
</script>
```

ChildComponent.vue:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Child Component</h2>
    <slot name="header"></slot>
    <slot></slot>
    <slot name="footer"></slot>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  // No additional logic needed for this example
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `ParentComponent` renders the `ChildComponent` and includes content within it. However, this time, we are using named slots.

The `ChildComponent` has three `<slot>` elements. The first `<slot>` element with `name="header"` is a named slot that will be filled with content from the parent component's `v-slot:header` template. The second `<slot>` element without a name acts as the default slot, which will receive any content that doesn't match a named slot. The third `<slot>` element with `name="footer"` is another named slot that will be filled with content from the parent component's `v-slot:footer` template.

When the parent component is rendered, the content within the named slots in the `<ChildComponent>` tags will be rendered at their respective `<slot>` locations in the child component.

This allows you to have more control over where specific content is rendered within the child component and gives you the flexibility to customize different parts of the component separately using the named slots.
